### Your Umbrella Command Kit

yuck is a bog-standard command line option parser for C that works with
only household ingredients (a C compiler and the m4 macro processor) and
comes with all the knickknackery and whatnots:
+ GNU-style long options (`--blah`)
+ condensable short options (`-xab` for `-x -a -b`)

However, yuck can also generate parsers for umbrella commands (think
git(1), ip(8), etc.) which seem to grow in popularity.
